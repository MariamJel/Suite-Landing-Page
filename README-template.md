## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This project helped me better my css skills. I had to face challenges of overlaping content as the code progressed from mobile  to first tablet and then destkop versions. During many trials and errors, I got more comfortable with using grid and also absolutely positioning items.
I got new insights on how to make websites responsive, which I am going to implement in my work from now on.
